TO-DO: Make an AI powered software that provides customer the potential present or future equipment failures


//TASK-1: Identify and understand the problem statement and return to conclusion about the dataset inference.
//main dataset- shows us the values for each equipment
//threshold dataset- shows us the required threshold for the working of the equipments.


//TASK-2: Improving the threshold dataset to make use of it, as it does not have any significance because we can not compare the value //attribute with the treshold attribute.
//For this task we are going to

First of all we have created a model which can predict whether the components will fail or not provided certain values for each of the features.
For creating the model we face few problems(e.g. aligning and merging the data with the provided threshold values)
Once we have created the model the next step will be to integrate the model with frontend(app/website) so that whenever a user/machine inputs a value, the app should display the prediction.
