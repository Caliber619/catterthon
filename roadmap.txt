TO-DO: Make an AI powered software that provides customer the potential present or future equipment failures


TASK-1: Identify and understand the problem statement and return to conclusion about the dataset inference.
main dataset- shows us the values for each equipment
threshold dataset- shows us the required threshold for the working of the equipments.


TASK-2: Improving the threshold dataset to make use of it, as it does not have any significance because we can not compare the value attribute with the treshold attribute.
For this task we are going to
